2. **Exploratory Text Analysis** - Understanding your data through visualization and statistics
3. **Data Collection for Research** - Collecting text data from web sources
4. **Understanding Language Models** - How transformers work and why they matter
5. **LLM Applications in Research** - Practical uses of language models in research
6. **Local Model Deployment** - Running models on your machine for privacy and control
7. **Cloud-Based Model Access** - Accessing powerful models through APIs
8. **Intelligent Search and Q&A** - Building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
9. **Knowledge Graph Applications** - Advanced retrieval using structured knowledge
10. **Deploying Research Tools** - Creating web applications for your research

## üéØ Research Philosophy: Inductive + Deductive = Powerful

This book demonstrates how LLMs can bridge traditional social science methodologies:

### **Qualitative ‚Üí Quantitative**
- **Inductive Analysis**: Extract themes from interviews, speeches, and documents
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring concepts across large text corpora
- **Content Analysis**: Automate coding of qualitative data
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Quantify emotional content in political discourse

### **Quantitative ‚Üí Qualitative** 
- **Deductive Testing**: Validate hypotheses with large-scale text analysis
- **Statistical Validation**: Test relationships between concepts and outcomes
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecast political events from text data
- **Causal Inference**: Identify causal relationships in textual data
